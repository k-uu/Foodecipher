#  *Foodecipher*
### By: Oskar Blyt

Wouldn't it be nice to get a better idea on how to recreate your favourite food brands at home?<br>
*Foodecipher* utilizes the Nutritional Facts and ingredient list on food packaging to estimate the
proportions in which ingredients occur. All that a user must provide are ***N*** core nutrient/mass ratios
for ***N*** ingredients: the larger ***N*** is, the closer you will get to the actual recipe.
>**Example:** Some core nutrient/mass ratios for 1% fat milk (according to the USDA)
> - Protein: 3.4 g / 100 g 
> - Total Fat:     1 g / 100 g
> - Saturated Fat: 0.6 g / 100 g
> - Sugar:   5 g / 100 g

 *Foodecipher* will return the beginning of a recipe with ingredients in grams. As some ingredients may contribute little to none toward the Nutritional Facts,  users must experiment and fill in the remaining blanks.
 <br> Additionally, this project aims to explore the some of the uses of linear algebra in a Java application.

### User Stories
As a user, I would like to be able to:

> - input an arbitrary number of ingredients and  core nutrient/mass ratios for a new recipe
> - view a list of all recipes created so far
> - view the ingredient proportions for an existing recipe
> - change an ingredient or core nutrient/mass ratio of an ingredient in an existing recipe
> - add a new ingredient and core nutrient/mass ratio to an existing recipe
> - remove an ingredient from an existing recipe
